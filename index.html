        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Neeraj Kumar. I am 20 years old and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a
            specialization in Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) from the Netaji Subhas University of Technology. I had
            finished my schooling at Evergreen Public School and currently living with my nuclear family in Delhi. I
            have many hobbies like sketching, doing origami, playing outdoor games, etc., but now I get little or no
            time to do all these activities, although I still love to do them. I love to try new things and want to
            learn more and more. I am a little impatient that sometimes results in anxiety, although I tried not to, but
            that didn't work for me. I had not planned much about my future because experience had shown me that didn't
            work. Presently I am trying to learn as much as possible during my four years of Engineering journey that
            will help me in developing my personal and technical skills. This is all that I have thought for myself. I
            love myself, my family, and my country very much and want to make them proud.</p>
