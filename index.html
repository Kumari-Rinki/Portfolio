        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Rinki and I am from Bihar, India. I enjoy meeting new people and making friends. I
            always like to Build Castle in the Skies. I love Dreaming with an Open Eyes, Always Looking for Something
            interesting in this universe. My hobbies include Watching movies and listening to soothing music while
            working, this makes me feel relaxed! <br>
            I am a kind of person who enjoys every second of her life to the fullest. I love to try new things and want
            to learn. But being a little impatient sometimes results in anxiety, although I tried not to,
            but that didn't work for me. I had not planned much about my future because experience had shown me that it
            don't work. Presently I am a B.com graduate, working girl and living a happy life with my nuclear family.
            I love my self, my family, my country and passionate about promoting independence and serving the aging
            population in my community. <br>
            Thanks for reading about me!</p>
