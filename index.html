        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Rinki and I am from Bihar, India. I enjoy meeting new people and making friends. I
            always like to Build Castle in the Sky. I love Dreaming with an Open Eyes, Always Looking for a Something
            interesting in this universe. My hobbies include Watching movies and listening to soothing music while
            working, this makes me relax you know! <br>
            I am a kind of person who enjoys every second of her life to the fullest. I love to try new things and want
            to learn more and more, but being a little impatient sometimes results in anxiety, although I tried not to,
            but that didn't work for me. I had not planned much about my future because experience had shown me that
            didn't work. Presently I am a B.com graduate, working women living a happy life with my nuclear family.
            I love my self, my family, my country and passionate about promoting independence and serving the aging
            population in my community. <br>
            Thanks for reading about me!</p>
